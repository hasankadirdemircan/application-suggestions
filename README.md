How is Warp Different from iTerm2 or Fig?
iTerm2 is a feature-rich macOS terminal emulator but doesn’t have AI-powered features or built-in collaboration.
Fig is an add-on that enhances existing terminals (like iTerm2), whereas Warp is a standalone terminal.
Warp provides an IDE-like experience, making it more powerful and user-friendly for modern developers.

Tools for Terminals:
Fig:
Fig is a tool that enhances the command-line experience by adding AI-powered autocomplete, snippets, and collaboration features to existing terminal emulators like iTerm2, macOS Terminal, VS Code Terminal,(Intellij IDEA) and Hyper. Instead of being a standalone terminal like Warp, Fig works as an add-on to improve your current terminal.

🔹 Snippets & Shortcuts – Lets you save and reuse frequently used commands.
🔹 Shell Plugin Management – Easily install and manage shell plugins for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
🔹 SSH Credential Sharing – Securely share SSH configurations and access.
🔹 Cross-Device Syncing – Keep your configurations and plugins synced across devices.

How is Fig Different from Warp?
Fig is an add-on, meaning it enhances your existing terminal (iTerm2, VS Code, etc.).
Warp is a standalone terminal, built from scratch with modern features.
Warp already has AI-powered autocomplete and IDE-like features, so using Fig with Warp is unnecessary.
